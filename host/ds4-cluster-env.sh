# ds4-cluster-env.sh — canonical env for the DeepSeek-V4 vLLM TP=2 cluster.
# Sourced by the ray head, the box2 ray worker, and vllm serve (both boxes keep
# an identical copy in each box's home). NCCL/RDMA transport knobs plus the
# winning DS4_* tuning knobs.
# Silence torch's per-step all_gather_into_tensor deprecation FutureWarning
# (fires on vLLM's logits all-gather every decode step -> journal spam). Only
# FutureWarnings are hidden; real errors/UserWarnings still log. Inherited by
# the ray workers spawned after this is sourced.
# Stable block-content hashes for the disk KV tier. Python seeds hash() randomly
# per process, and vLLM derives NONE_HASH (the prefix-cache chain seed) from it,
# so without a fixed value identical token content produces different block
# filenames every run and the disk cache can never hit across a restart.

# Bound allocator growth. The caching allocator never returns freed blocks, and
# its garbage collector is off by default (threshold 0), so the pool only
# grows without bound on a UMA box.
# The threshold is a fraction of total visible memory (~124 GiB here), so 0.85
# starts reclaiming unused cached blocks at ~105 GiB. It cannot starve a live
# allocation -- only cached blocks are reclaimed -- so the cost is re-mapping,
# never an OOM.
# expandable_segments lets the allocator grow/shrink segments in virtual address
# space instead of stranding fixed-size blocks. That is the fragmentation half:
# the GC threshold alone fires at ~105 GiB but does not hold the line, because
# GC can only reclaim blocks
# that are unused, and fragmented blocks that cannot satisfy incoming requests
# make the allocator grow anyway. Safe with --enforce-eager (no graph capture).
