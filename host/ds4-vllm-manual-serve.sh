# Production vLLM launcher (512K ctx + MTP, RDMA). Run INSIDE the vllm container;
# started by the ds4-vllm-manual systemd user unit. Sources the canonical RDMA
# cluster-env, then execs vllm serve on api_port from ds4-config.yaml.
#
# THIS FILE IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH -- run it straight from the repo checkout
# (host/), same path on both boxes. No deployment copy needed.
#
# Memory flags, since they are the ones that bite:
#   --kv-cache-memory-bytes  Pin KV. Inferring it oversubscribes this box: the
#     bf16 weight cache and the RDMA buffers are allocated AFTER the profiling
#     pass that would do the inferring. The pool is a fixed-size LRU: it does not
#     grow with --max-model-len, and its occupancy is NOT what
#     vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc reports (that metric counts only blocks referenced
#     by in-flight requests; cached-but-idle blocks sit in the free queue and
#     read as free). Capacity = (pin / bytes-per-block) blocks x 256 tokens.
#   --gpu-memory-utilization  INERT while the pin above is set -- vLLM skips
#     memory profiling and ignores it entirely (gpu_worker.py:384).
#   --max-num-batched-tokens 512  NOT 2048; the indexer/top-k workspace scales
#     with batch x context and 2048 costs ~10 GiB more at 256K.
#
# Do not add comments inside the backslash-continued `vllm serve` command below:
# a '#' there silently comments out every remaining argument, and `bash -n`
# still reports the file as valid.

# NVMe KV cache (fs_lru tier), ON by default. Prefix blocks evicted from GPU
# are kept on node-local disk and reloaded instead of re-prefilled, and the
# cache survives a restart -- the case the in-GPU prefix cache cannot cover.
#
# The tier is DISTRIBUTED: the scheduler decides what to store/evict/promote,
# but every rank does its own file I/O against its own slice of its own
# node-local mmap, under <dir>/<model>_r<rank>/ (r0 on this box, r1 on box2).
# That is a correctness requirement, not an optimization: a tier that moves
# bytes only on the scheduler's node restores garbage on the remote rank,
# and bad KV degrades recall silently instead of raising. If recall ever
# drops on restored prefixes, FIRST check both boxes' cache dirs are being
# written.
#
#   DS4_DISK_KV_BYTES      per-NODE disk cap, default 30 GiB. Not optional --
#                          the stock "fs" tier has no capacity argument and
#                          never evicts. Check df on BOTH boxes before
#                          raising it, and expect it to sit full under real
#                          traffic: LRU churn at the cap is normal. Each box
#                          stores only its own rank's slice (~1 MiB per
#                          block file, ~100 tokens/file across the groups).
#   DS4_DISK_KV_CPU_BYTES  CPU staging tier, default 4 GiB. Disk is a secondary
#                          tier behind a CPU primary and ROCm has no GPU->disk
#                          path, so blocks land in host memory first.
#
#                          4 GiB does NOT cost 4 GiB of RAM. With staging on
#                          disk (below) the region is a file-backed mmap, so it
#                          is reclaimable page cache -- resident only while hot,
#                          dropped under pressure. That is the entire reason for
#                          moving it off tmpfs, and it is what lets this be
#                          sized for correctness rather than for RAM.
#
#                          A read hit requires the matched prefix to be
#                          simultaneously resident in this tier, so keep it
#                          comfortably above the block count of the longest
#                          prefix you expect to reuse.
#
# The KV pin below is 6 GiB (~1.44M tokens). The pool size decides how often
# a session resume pays a multi-second disk restore instead of hitting the
# GPU prefix cache, so size it as large as MemAvailable tolerates; staging
# is file-backed page cache, not a tmpfs reservation, so the disk cache adds
# no reserved RAM on top of this pin.
#
# Staging also defaults onto the NVMe (DS4_DISK_KV_STAGE_ON_DISK=0 to keep it in
# /dev/shm). tmpfs pages are charged to RAM and can only be pushed to swap; a
# real file makes them ordinary page cache, which the kernel writes back and
# evicts cleanly, so staging stops being a reservation. Costs unpinned DMA for
# the GPU->host copy (cudaHostRegister is skipped deliberately -- page-locking
# would undo the whole point). If decode or TTFT regresses, set
# DS4_DISK_KV_STAGE_ON_DISK=0 and compare.

# The tier ships in the image, not in this script. Against an image built
# before it, vllm serve dies at startup with "Unknown secondary tier type:
# 'fs_lru'" -- so a restart that happens before container/build.sh has run (a
# crash, the watchdog, a reboot) would take the engine down rather than merely
# skip the cache. Degrade to no cache instead, loudly. distributed.py is the
# newer half (per-rank data plane); an image with only the old lru_manager
# would run the scheduler-side tier that corrupts rank1's restores.
